# RMarkdown
Tutorials for learning R Markdown from RLadies Nijmegen.

First: download everything and save it some place useful!

Then: look at the RPackagesInstaller file. Open in R and run the lines you need to install any packages you don't have already. (For brand-new R users:  this will probably just be everything)

The folder 'Guided-tutorial' is a project folder that contains everything you need to compile today's slides. First, open the project file 'RMarkDownTutorial_RLadiesNijmegen'.  This will load a workspace and data. Run the script 'Guided-tutorials.Rmd' and Knit to make the slides!

The file 'RLadies-GDD.rmd' is an R markdown script that calls 'FAO2.csv' and 'world-political-map.jpg'.  It's structured as a hands-on actvity about the ins and outs of R markdown and Tidy data summarization and plotitng.
